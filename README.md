# Binary_Search_Tree_with_Duplicates

## Assignment Summary
- Implement a binary search tree to allow duplicates.
  - <em>Hint</em>: Have each node store a data structure of items that are considered duplicates (using the first item in this structure) tocontrol branching.

- In addition to the existing operators of the tree, implement also the following:
  - Return number of duplicates of an element.
  - Find and replace all duplicates of an element A with element B.
  - Show all the tree together with the duplicates (pre-order, in-order, post-order, level-order).
  - Remove all existing duplicates (leaving only one copy) of an element.
  - Remove only one copy of the existing duplicates of an element.
  - Remove all existing duplicates (leaving only one copy) for all the duplicated elements in tree.
  - Print all elements that have duplicates together with the number of duplicates.
  - Print the number of all the duplicates in the tree.
  - Show only the nodes that have/do not have duplicates.
